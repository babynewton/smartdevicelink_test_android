<h1>Put File</h1>

The PutFile command allows developers to send various types of files that can be dynamically stored on the head-unit.  Any files that are added through this command
can be referenced by the associated filename.

<p>
In order to add a file to the head-unit system, your application needs to specify the following parameters:

<p>
<h2>SDL File Name (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
This is the filename that the file will be stored as on the head-unit.  This name must be unique and must be between 1-500 characters in length.

<p>
<h2>SDL File Type (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Enumerated Value</h3>
</br>
This parameter represents what type of file is being sent to the head-unit system through SDL.

<h3>Available File Type Options</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumerated Value</th>
<th>File Type</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GRAPHIC_BMP</td>
<td>A bitmap image</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GRAPHIC_JPEG</td>
<td>A JPEG image</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GRAPHIC_PNG</td>
<td>A PNG image</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AUDIO_WAVE</td>
<td>A WAVE audio file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AUDIO_MP3</td>
<td>An MP3 audio file</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
<h2>Persistent (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Boolean</h3>
</br>
If this parameter is set to true, the head-unit system will attempt to save the file across ignition cycles.  If the system requires storage for higher priority files, this file may be deleted.
When this parameter is false (or null), the application will need to send the files each session.

<p>
<h2>Bulk Data (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: byte[]</h3>
</br>
The final, and most important parameter for the PutFile command is the raw byte array of the file to be sent to the system.
