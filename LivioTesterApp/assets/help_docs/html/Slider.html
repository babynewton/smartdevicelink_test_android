<h1>Slider</h1>

The Slider command allows developers to display a slider widget on the head-unit's display.  This could be useful for various tasks, such as
changing the phone's ringer volume through SDL.

<p>
In order to show a slider for your application, the following parameters are available:

<p>
<h2>Slider Header (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
This text will be displayed above the slider widget and should be a concise description of what the slider input will change in the application.

<p>
<h2>Slider Footer (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Vector&#60;String&#62;</h3>
</br>
This text will be displayed below the slider widget.

<p>
<h2>Number of Ticks (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Integer</h3>
</br>
This represents the maximum number of selections that will be available on the slider widget.  This number must be at least 2 and cannot be greater than 26.

<p>
<h2>Start Position (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Integer</h3>
</br>
This represents the initial selection on the slider widget.  This number must be at least 1 and cannot be greater than the number of ticks.

<p>
<h2>Timeout (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Integer</h3>
</br>
This represents the number of milliseconds to display the widget before it times out.  The current selection of the widget will be returned through the response 
message when the timeout occurs or when the user exits the slider widget.  This number must be between 0 and 65535 milliseconds.
