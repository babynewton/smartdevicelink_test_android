<h1>Add Submenu</h1>

The AddSubmenu command allows developers to add a submenu object into the head-unit's main menu.  When the item on the head-unit is clicked, 
the submenu's contents are displayed.  As of SDL 2.0, only 1 level of submenus are permitted.  In other words, submenus can only be added to 
the root-level main menu and only commands can be added to existing submenus.

<p>
Submenus that have been added to the system's main menu can be removed through the <a href="DeleteSubmenu.html">DeleteSubmenu</a> command.

<p>
An AddSubmenu command only requires a single input to create a submenu on the head-unit's main menu:

<p>
<h2>Submenu Name (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
The submenu name represents the text to display within the body of this submenu on the head-unit's main menu.  This text should be a short description of what this menu will display when clicked.
