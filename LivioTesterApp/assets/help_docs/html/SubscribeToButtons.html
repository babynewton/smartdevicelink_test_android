<h1>Subscribe to Buttons</h1>

The ButtonSubscribe command allows the developer to subscribe to hardware buttons that are contained in the vehicle.  When one of the subscribed buttons 
is pressed, the event is dispatched to the onOnButtonPress method in the SDL service.

<p>
Button subscriptions are currently handled one at a time, so if the application would like to subscribe to multiple buttons, a separate message must be
sent for each button.

<p>
In order to subscribe the application to hardware buttons, only one parameter is required:

<p>
<h2>ButtonName (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Enumerated Value</h3>
</br>
Represents the button to subscribe to.

<h3>Available Button Name Options</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumerated Value</th>
<th>Button Name</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OK</td>
<td>Represents the OK and PLAY buttons.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PRESET0 - PRESET9</td>
<td>Represents the preset buttons.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SEEK_LEFT</td>
<td>Represents the left seek button.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SEEK_RIGHT</td>
<td>Represents the right seek button.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TUNE_UP</td>
<td>Represents the up tune button.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TUNE_DOWN</td>
<td>Represents the down tune button.</td>
</tr>

</table>
