<h1>Show</h1>

The Show command allows developers to set lines of text on the main HMI display.  For non-media applications, 4 lines of text are available.  For media applications,
the 4th line of text is replaced with a media clock that can be manipulated through the <a href="SetMediaClockTimer.html">SetMediaClockTimer</a> command.  In addition,
an image can also be displayed on the main HMI display.

<p>
The Show command useful for all applications to keep users informed as to what is happening inside the application.  For example, when a music player application
starts to play a new song, the first line of text could display the song name, the second line could display the artist name, the third line could display
which album the song is from while the last line would show the current clock timer for the song in progress.  The album art for the playing song could be 
displayed as the main artwork.

<p>
In order to make a change to the main HMI display through the show command, the following parameters are available:

<p>
<h2>Lines of Text (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
Each line of metadata can be represented as its own string object.

<p>
<h2>Text Alignment (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Enumerated Value</h3>
</br>
The text alignment input tells the head-unit how the lines of text should be aligned.

<h3>Available Text Alignment Options</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumerated Value</th>
<th>Text Alignment</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ALIGN_LEFT</td>
<td>All lines of text should be left-aligned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ALIGN_RIGHT</td>
<td>All lines of text should be right-aligned.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ALIGN_CENTER</td>
<td>All lines of text should be centered.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
<h2>Image (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Image</h3>
</br>
The image object represents an image to be displayed on the head-unit's main HMI display.  Images must have been added 
to the system through the <a href="PutFile.html">PutFile</a> command before they can be referenced for a Show command.
