<h1>Set Media Clock Timer</h1>

The SetMediaClockTimer command allows developers to manage a clock timer on the head-unit.  This command is only applicable for media applications,
such as music players or radio applications.  If the connected application is not a media application, the line of text that contains the timer text
will be replaced with the 4th line of text in the <a href="Show.html">Show</a> command.  Therefore, if the connected application is a media application,
the 4th line of text in the <a href="Show.html">Show</a> command will be inaccessible and replaced with the clock timer.

<p>
In order for a media application to manage the clock timer, 2 parameters are needed:

<p>
<h2>Timer Mode (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Enumerated Value</h3>
</br>
The timer mode represents what the timer should do when this command is received.

<h3>Available Timer Mode Options</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumerated Value</th>
<th>Timer Mode</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>COUNT_UP</td>
<td>The timer should count-up from the input start time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>COUNT_DOWN</td>
<td>The timer should count-down from the input start time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PAUSE</td>
<td>The timer should pause.  Input start time will be ignored.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>RESUME</td>
<td>The timer should resume.  Input start time will be ignored.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CLEAR</td>
<td>The timer should pause and reset to 00:00:00.  Input start time will be ignored.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
<h2>Start Time (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: StartTime</h3>
</br>
This object represents a start time with hours, minutes and seconds as parameters.  The start time is mandatory for
COUNT_UP and COUNT_DOWN timer modes, but optional for other timer modes.
