<h1>Alert</h1>

The Alert command allows developers to display a pop-up alert object on the head-unit UI.  The alert command has the ability to display 3 lines of text as well as speak a message to the driver.  Alerts are also able to play an alert sound as the pop-up appears.

<p>
To create an alert on the head-unit, 6 inputs are available:

<p>
<h2>Text to Speak (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
The text to speak for an alert message will be spoken to the driver by the vehicle's text to speech engine.  This text should be a concise message telling the user what the alert is about. 

<p>
<h2>Alert Lines (at least 1 required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
Alert messages are permitted to have up to 3 lines of text to alert the user.  Alert messages should be concise and relevant to what the user is doing.

<p>
<h2>Alert Sound Enable (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Boolean</h3>
</br>
If your alert desires the vehicle's speakers to play an alert sound, set this value to true.  If no sound is desired, set this value to false.

<p>
<h2>Alert Duration (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Integer</h3>
</br>
This value represents how long the alert should be displayed to the user.  The duration parameter is an integer representing how many milliseconds the alert should be displayed for.
